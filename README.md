<h1>Welcome to "python--"!</h1>
<h5>! This is in no shape or form associated with the real python project and not meant to ridicule it, I was just lazy with the name. !</h5>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
This heresy of a language has been (or is being) created by me as an alternative form of passing my C++ exercises at Rzesz√≥w University of Technology. It's loosely based on python's syntax with some personal touches.
<h3>And what does it do?</h3>
It's a simple interpreted language, with support for reading .p-- files and reading user input directly. It's supposed to be able to do simple math and print operations, maybye file saving/reading.
<h3>Why is everything in english if this is for a polish university?</h3>
Why not? I like using english in programming.
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<h5>Note: these features are subject to change at any moment</h5>
<li>functions can be defined by user</li>
<li>there are global and local variables</li>
<li>function recursion is supported</li>
<li>functions can implicitly convert all inputs to a given type if possible</li>
<li>there is a standard library calling native c++ functions</li>
<li>interpreter uses standard functions or has variants for at least Linux and Windows</li>
<li>variables can be explicitly changed to other types, replacing the old variable</li>
<li>can be called from bash/console or directly</li>
<li>function arguments not written in a bracket can be treated as multiple variables in some cases</li>
</ul>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
A "Hello world" in python--:

~~~
Print("Hello world!")
> Hello world!
~~~
Nothing special, right? </br>
Then feast your eyes upon this unholy print statement:

~~~
Print( 5 + " + " + 6 + " = " + (5 + 6))
> 5 + 6 = 11
~~~
What? </br>
In python-- Print() is a type of function mentioned earlier, it converts all its arguments to strings implicitly. The values in brackets are seen as one per another point. This empowers the user to create incredible feats of lexical gymnastics like this in a single statement!

<h3>The rest of this and the language in under construction, hold on!</h3>
