<h1>Welcome to "python--"!</h1>
<h5>! This is in no shape or form associated with the real python project and not meant to ridicule it, I was just lazy with the name. !</h5>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
This heresy of a language has been (or is being) created by me as an alternative form of passing my C++ exercises at Rzesz√≥w University of Technology. It's loosely based on python's syntax with some personal touches.
<h3>And what does it do?</h3>
It's a simple interpreted language, with support for reading .p-- files and reading user input directly. It's supposed to be able to do simple math and print operations, maybye file saving/reading.
<h3>Why is everything in english if this is for a polish university?</h3>
Why not? I like using english in programming.
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<h5>Note: these features are subject to change at any moment</h5>
<li>functions can be defined by user</li>
<li>there are global and local variables</li>
<li>function recursion is supported</li>
<li>functions can implicitly convert all inputs to a given type if possible</li>
<li>there is a standard library calling native c++ functions</li>
<li>interpreter uses standard functions or has variants for at least Linux and Windows</li>
<li>can be called from bash/console or directly</li>
<li>function arguments not written in a bracket can be treated as multiple variables in some cases</li>
</ul>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
A "Hello world" in python--:
```
Print("Hello world!")
> Hello world!
```
Nothing special, right? </br>
Then feast your eyes upon this unholy print statement:

```
Print( 5 + " + " + 6 + " = " + (5 + 6))
> 5 + 6 = 11
```
What? </br>
In python-- Print() has the "implicit" keyword before it's string argument, it converts all its arguments to strings implicitly. 

```
Print(implicit string message)
```
All the bracket-less arguments are affected and then added. This empowers the user to create incredible feats of lexical gymnastics like this in a single statement </br>
You can also see the next difference: functions are typed and don't need ':' after them. Actually this makes writing multiple expressions in a line impossible, and the parser much simpler. </br>
Some functions have c++ native binds, these are realised via a special type of function, not possible to create from the language itself and are fully separate from user functions.</br></br>
This function doesn't return any value, but when one does, it does so explicitly:
```
int StringLength(implicit string str)
```
Yeah, there are no objects.</br></br>
Indentations are important:
```
implicit int foo(int a, string b)
    return a + b
Println(foo(3, "4"))
Print("This is so silly!")
> 7
> This is so silly!
```
The keyword "implicit" can be used anywhere with variables, but in some cases it can generate exceptions:
```
implicit int foo(string a)
    a = a + "not a number"
    return a <- exception here
    
implicit int b = 5 + " + " + 7 + " = " + (5 + 7) <- exception here
```
The "implicit" keyword henerally allows for type conversions:
```
int var = 5
string str = "This equals "
implicit str += var;
```

<h3>The rest of this and the language in under construction, even the functions here don't work yet, hold on!</h3>
